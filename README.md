To Do List  
1. Calculate team ratings for each round; compare to AFL ladder - https://mafl-online.squarespace.com/mafl-stats-journal/2013/10/13/building-your-own-team-rating-system.html  
2. Calculate home game advantage, interstate advantage    
3. Download back to 1990?  
4. What game statistics matter?  http://www.matterofstats.com/mafl-stats-journal/2013/6/29/game-statistics-and-game-outcomes.html - look at relationship between game stats and game outcomes (final score); remove colinearity, high correlation stats  
5. What stats matter for dream team?  https://mafl-online.squarespace.com/mafl-stats-journal/2013/6/16/game-statistics-and-the-dream-team.html  
6. Build a rating system for each player.  How does this compare to the team rating?  
7. Download fixture for each season to map player/team performance over time.  
8. Read statistical models - http://www.matterofstats.com/where-can-i-find-a-mafl-statistical-model-of-x  
9. Algorithms - http://www.matterofstats.com/where-can-i-find-an-example-of-the-use-of-x  
10. Think about a dashboard - http://www.matterofstats.com/mafl-team-dashboards/matterofstats-2018-team-dashboard-for-round-23  
11. Investigate ELO and other rating systems - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system  
12. Each stat can be grouped into action/reaction functions and hence may be interdependent (correlated).  Each stat can also correspond to particular skills (accuracy, hand-eye, foot-eye, agility, speed) and may be grouped in this manner. 
13. Each position will require particular skills more than others.
