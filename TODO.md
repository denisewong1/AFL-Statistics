## To Do List  
1. Document architecture and names here 
2. Build mapping tables to be uploaded at each run  
3. Calculate team ratings for each round; compare to AFL ladder - https://mafl-online.squarespace.com/mafl-stats-journal/2013/10/13/building-your-own-team-rating-system.html  
4. Calculate home game advantage, interstate advantage, venue experience - http://www.matterofstats.com/mafl-stats-journal/2010/9/20/adding-some-spline-to-your-models.html     
5. What game statistics matter?  http://www.matterofstats.com/mafl-stats-journal/2013/6/29/game-statistics-and-game-outcomes.html - look at relationship between game stats and game outcomes (final score); remove colinearity, high correlation stats  
6. What stats matter for dream team?  https://mafl-online.squarespace.com/mafl-stats-journal/2013/6/16/game-statistics-and-the-dream-team.html  
7. Build a rating system for each player.  How does this compare to the team rating?  
8. Read statistical models - http://www.matterofstats.com/where-can-i-find-a-mafl-statistical-model-of-x  
9. Algorithms - http://www.matterofstats.com/where-can-i-find-an-example-of-the-use-of-x  
10. Think about a dashboard - http://www.matterofstats.com/mafl-team-dashboards/matterofstats-2018-team-dashboard-for-round-23  
11. Investigate ELO and other rating systems - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system  
12. Each stat can be grouped into action/reaction functions and hence may be interdependent (correlated).  Each stat can also correspond to particular skills (accuracy, hand-eye, foot-eye, agility, speed) and may be grouped in this manner. 
13. Each player position will value particular skills more than others - https://thearcfooty.com/2016/10/15/classifying-players-positions-using-public-data/  
14. Player Skills - https://fenixbazaar.com/2017/05/05/afl-evolution-career-mode-tips-guide-to-become-a-pro/  
15. weekly team lineup - http://www.afl.com.au/news/teams?round=1  
16. from Justin - The team stats by round are under the same website but under the team tab.  There are extra stats under the the advanced options but you cant view them all at once. They are not needed for AFL fantasy but I like to run some stats on them.
1.       Pick the right rookies
2.       Plan for bye rounds
3.       12 premium players
4.       Bulk of scorers are from midfield
5.       Scores of best 18 players from overall match squad for bye rounds
6.       Trade injured players immediately
7.       Find a measure of consistency
8.       Identify undervalued aspects of player performance – this is more important than accuracy
9.       Use a two year history
10.   100 point player – consistency, valuation
11.   Distribution of points earned FO/DE/MI/RU
12.   Margin of victory impact on fantasy points
13.   Breakeven point score for each player – try to guess?
14.   Use expert starting team in lineup – rookies midpriced and stars
